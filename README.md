# Hospital
During the studying I was developing the project â€“ The Hospital. It includes a system for making appointments(*The appointments are created automatically for each doctor*). I made the ability to keep records of medical histories of patients and records of the execution of various medical processes (*operations, procedures, medications*).
Users with the **User role** can make and cancel their appointments.
Follow the treatment history of their diseases and see who and when executed the processes Users with the **Nurse role** can execute processes such as medication and procedures and viewing patient medical records.Users with the **Doctor role** can also execute operations, create new medical records and add new patients.The appointments can also be canceled by doctors. Users with the **Admin role** can make the same things and they can also make different changes (change password, email, photo, add and remove roles) for users.Every user has to verify their email address during registration . And bind their user account to the patient. They receive different messages about making and canceling of an appointment
